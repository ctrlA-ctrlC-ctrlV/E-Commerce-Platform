### ==Project: E-Commerce Product Listing Platform (Full-Stack)== - Current

#### **Description**:

This project involves building a minimal e-commerce platform that allows users to:

- Browse products
- Search for specific items
- View detailed product information

The platform demonstrates full-stack capabilities, API integration, database management, and deployment with containerization/orchestration tools.

------

### **Features**

#### **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**

##### **User Interface (Frontend):**

- Home page displaying a list of products.
- Search functionality to filter products.
- Product details page showing information like name, description, price, and image.

##### **Backend (API):**

- RESTful API for retrieving product data (GET endpoints).
- Search API to filter products by name, category, or other criteria.

##### **Database:**

- SQL database to store product information (e.g., name, description, price, stock, category, and image URL).

##### **Deployment:**

- Use Docker to containerize both the frontend and backend.
- Basic deployment on a local machine or a simple cloud server.

------

### **Stretch Features**

#### **Add-to-Cart Functionality:**

- Allow users to add items to a virtual cart and view cart contents.
- Calculate the total price and quantity of items in the cart.

#### **User Authentication:**

- Enable users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.
- Secure endpoints for user-specific features (e.g., cart management).

#### **Advanced Search & Filters:**

- Add filters for price range, category, and stock availability.

#### **Cloud Deployment:**

- Deploy the app using Kubernetes on a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

------

### **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (using hooks or Context API for state management)
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI or Django REST Framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (recommended for production) or SQLite (for local development)
- **Deployment Tools**: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration
- **Authentication (Stretch Goal)**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
